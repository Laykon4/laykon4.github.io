# Whoami ?

## A little animal interlude before introducing myself :
Outside of school and work, I am a huge fan of red pandas, adorable little animals that are unfortunately endangered. I invite you to visit the [CPPR](https://cppr-pandaroux.org/) website to learn more about these creatures and support their conservation!

**Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è**

## üë§Profile
### About me :
A second-year student in the south of France, I am passionate about new technologies and innovative projects. Currently in a work-study program, I have the opportunity to combine academics with hands-on experience, which allows me to quickly develop practical skills. I'm gradually starting to get into the world of ethical hacking and cybersecurity. I'm only at the beginning of the journey, and there‚Äôs a long road ahead. I also love red pandas **([CPPR](https://cppr-pandaroux.org/))**!
