# Iso Auto Downloader 
### I think we gonna call it `IAD`, it's clearly better.

So whats IAD ?
You probably read it on my [About page](https://laykon4.github.io/about/) but i'm a student and 80% of my work is done on virtual machines. So i must download iso images of a lot of OS and after sometimes there is always new releases.

i was tired of having to download the new versions every 2 weeks of each OS that's why i created **IFAD**.

<br><br>

# How it works ?
So firstly i have made two documents, one in French (my native language) and the second in English.

You can find the English one directly on my [Github repo](https://github.com/Laykon4/Iso-Auto-Downloader) and the French one can be downloaded in PDF just [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1134410578304184360/1305949498706493481/Auto_telechargement_diso.pdf?ex=6734e3bf&is=6733923f&hm=98b966cf9a5758138f1a04fa0c616d8185a75fc022c1bb26faab58dd6c180b31&) (He dont work anymore, wait till i rewrite it )

<br>

And for my beautiful blog i'll also explain how it works here.
<br>

> Before running the script there is few prerequisites that you can find on the `readme` file.
{: .prompt-info }

Before everything, the script will define a variable where the ISOs files will be installed.
```powershell
$folderName = "IsoAD"
$desktopPath = "$env:USERPROFILE\desktop\$folderName"
```

Then it will check if the directory already exists. 
> This condition must be added to every function to check if the `$distro` directory already exists.
{: .prompt-tip }
```powershell
if (Test-Path -Path $desktopPath) {
    Write-Host "The folder '$folderName' already exists on the desktop." -ForegroundColor Yellow
} else {
    Write-Host "The folder '$folderName' does not exist. Creating it now..." -ForegroundColor Green
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $desktopPath
    Write-Host "The folder '$folderName' has been created at: $folderPath" -ForegroundColor Cyan
}
```

### Now, we can start :

First step : <br> The script create function for each OS with the URL of releases page, the local installation path, and the pattern of the iso file name using a regex

```powershell
    $distro = "Debian" # Name of final directory in IsoAD
    $debianUrl = "https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/"
    $debianIsoPattern = "debian-[\d.]+-amd64-netinst\.iso"
    $debianLocalPath = "$env:USERPROFILE\desktop\$folderName\$distro\"
    $sha256LocalPath = "$env:USERPROFILE\desktop\$folderName\$distro\"
    $sha256Url = "https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/SHA256SUMS"
```
> Some distro can have different format because of their parameters
{: .prompt-info }
<br>
Then it try to match the pattern with the content of the page then check who's the most recent file and download it if needed. If the file doesn't exist, the script will automatically download it. And it will compare the hash values.

```powershell
Write-Host "You selected Debian. Proceeding with Debian setup..."
    $response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $debianUrl
    $pageContent = $response.Content

    $isoFile = [regex]::Match($pageContent, $debianIsoPattern).Value

    if ($isoFile) {
        $latestIsoUrl = "$debianUrl$isoFile"
        $localPath = "$debianLocalPath$isoFile"

        if (Test-Path -Path $localPath) {
            $localLastModified = (Get-Item -Path $localPath).LastWriteTime

            $remoteLastModified = $response.Headers["Last-Modified"]
            $remoteLastModifiedDate = [DateTime]::ParseExact($remoteLastModified, "R", $null)

            if ($remoteLastModifiedDate -gt $localLastModified) {
                Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $latestIsoUrl -OutFile $localPath
                Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $sha256Url -OutFile $sha256LocalPath

                $calcSha256 = (Get-FileHash -Path $latestIsoUrl -Algorithm SHA256).Hash
                $expectedSha256 = Select-String -Path $sha256LocalPath -Pattern ([System.IO.Path]::GetFileName($latestIsoUrl)) | ForEach-Object { $_ -replace "\s.*", "" }
                if ($calcSha256 -eq $expectedSha256) {
                    Write-Host "The file is valid :" -NoNewline
                    Write-Host " SHA-256 hash matches." -ForegroundColor Green
                } else {
                    Write-Host "The file is corrupted or modified :" -NoNewline
                    Write-Host " SHA-256 hash does not match." -ForegroundColor Red
                }
            
                Write-Host "Debian : The new files were downloaded :" -NoNewline
                Write-Host " $isoFile | $sha256url" -ForegroundColor Green
            } else {
                Write-Host "Debian : The iso and sha256 file are already up to date."
            }
        } 
        else {
            Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $latestIsoUrl -OutFile $localPath
            Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $sha256Url -OutFile $sha256LocalPath

            Write-Host "Debian : The ISO and sha256 file did not exist locally and was downloaded :" -NoNewline
            Write-Host " $isoFile | $sha256url" -ForegroundColor Green

            if ($calcSha256 -eq $expectedSha256) {
                Write-Host "The file is valid :" -NoNewline
                Write-Host " SHA-256 hash matches." -ForegroundColor Green
            } else {
                Write-Host "The file is corrupted or modified :" -NoNewline
                Write-Host " SHA-256 hash does not match." -ForegroundColor Red
            }
        }
```
> The code is not the same for every distro
{: .prompt-info }

<br>
If nothing match, it will print a messages in the log file.

```powershell
else {
  Write-Host "Debian : No ISO files found in the directory." -ForegroundColor Red
}
```

# Choosing OS
### Actually there is `4` OS available in the script
<br>

So how to choose which OS to download ?
```powershell
$choice = Read-Host "Choose an OS type : `n 1 - Debian `n 2 - Kali Linux `n 3 - Ubuntu `n 4 - Arch Linux `n 5 - Linux Mint `n 99 - Download all `n Your choice "


$osType = switch ($choice) {
    "1" { debian }
    "2" { kaliLinux }
    "3" { ubuntu }
    "4" { archLinux }
    "5" { linuxMint }
    "99" {dlAll}
    Default { "Unknown" }
}
```
Simple is that : One Read-Host and one switch statement

The last choice `"99" {dlAll}` is a function to search and download all iso file available if needed.
