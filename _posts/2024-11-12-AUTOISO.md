# Iso File Auto Downloader 

### I think we gonna call it `IFAD`, it's clearly better.

So whats IFAD ?
You probably read it on my [About page](https://laykon4.github.io/about/) but i'm a student and 80% of my work is done on virtual machines. So i must download iso images of a lot of OS and after sometimes there is always new releases.

i was tired of having to download the new versions every 2 weeks of each OS thaths why i created **IFAD**.

<br><br>

# How it works ?
So firstly i have made two documents, one in French (my native language) and the second in English.

You can find the English one directly on my [Github repo](https://github.com/Laykon4/Iso-Auto-Downloader) and the French one can be downloaded in PDF just [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1134410578304184360/1305949498706493481/Auto_telechargement_diso.pdf?ex=6734e3bf&is=6733923f&hm=98b966cf9a5758138f1a04fa0c616d8185a75fc022c1bb26faab58dd6c180b31&)

<br>

And for my beautiful blog i'll also explain how it works here.

First step here : <br> We must chose which OS iso we want (more options will come in the future)

<br><br>

Once done, the script will update the url of the releases page, the local installation path, and the pattern of the iso file name using a regex <br>

<br><br>

Then it will look for if the file exists. If so, it will compare the dates of changes and download if it is more recent <br>
